          Philadelphia Assembled is an expansive project that tells a story of
          radical community building and active resistance through the personal
          and collective narratives that make up Philadelphia’s changing urban
          fabric. These narratives will be explored through a collaborative
          effort between the Philadelphia Museum of Art and a team of
          individuals, collectives, and organizations as they experiment with
          multiple methodologies for amplifying and connecting relationships in
          Philadelphia’s transforming landscape. Challenging, inspiring, and as
          big as the city, Philadelphia Assembled asks: how can we collectively
          shape our futures?
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          The Philadelphia Assembled Project interprets these narratives and
          actions through five atmospheres: Futures, Reconstruction,
          Sovereignty, Sanctuary and Movement. The following essay is an
          interpretation of how the PHLASK Project can contribute to each
          atmosphere.

        At the heart of the PHLASK Project is the imperative to recast water
        from a resource that can be commoditized into a shared resource for all
        life. Decolonizing the commodification of water begins by shifting the
        attitudes of how we consume water. The PHLASK project wants to normalize
        water as a resource to be shared by rejecting the capitalist
        infrastructure that exists to profit from the sale of water.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHLASK believes that an effective tactic to transforming water into a
        shared resource is to, quite literally, encourage people to start
        sharing water. The PHLASK Project in many ways is a sociological
        initiative to normalize behavior around sharing water. Given how
        inefficient, wasteful and expensive bottled water is, the act of sharing
        water from existing water infrastructure is an almost no-cost solution
        to reducing waste and increasing access to water.
      </p>
      <h3 id="reconstructions">Reconstructions:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “…reconstructions do not search for a former authenticity, but hold a
          complex identity that encompasses past and present. They are
          (re)claimed, (re)built, (re)written, (re)worked. The Reconstructions
          atmosphere is specifically focusing its efforts on identifying spaces
          that speak to re-writing personal and collective narratives through
          the lenses of mass incarceration and displacement.” (Philadelphia
          Assembled)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        PHLASK’s goal of liberating water resources for the public welfare
        carries the spirit of rewriting, rebuilding and reclaiming that which
        has been exploited and controlled. Sharing water requires both a
        ‘reconstruction’ of physical spaces and social norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The physical infrastructures that supply us with potable water are
        publicly and privately controlled. With the exception of public water
        fountains, though, even public infrastructure is beset with varying
        degrees of private ownership. PHLASK aims to reconstruct this existing
        hybrid public-private infrastructure as a more radically open and
        accessible public water utility. When future water infrastructure is
        constructed, hopefully it will hew to more radical water-sharing design
        principles that increase public access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reconstructing the physical infrastructures begins with reconstructing
        the social norms around accessing water, and asks, “why can’t people
        access the vast majority of private taps linked to the public water
        infrastructure?” It is our hope that, over the long-term, as private
        businesses, organizations, enterprises and individuals choose to share
        access to their taps that access to water will be reconstructed as a
        norm for sharing water.
      </p>
      <h3 id="sovereignty">Sovereignty:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “..the Sovereignty atmosphere seeks to address the specific concepts
          of land and the alternative marketplace as each relates to histories
          of self-determination, the preservation of community wisdom, and new
          forms of cultural exchange.” (Philadelphia Assembled)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reconceptualizing water as a resource for sharing falls squarely into
        the atmosphere of sovereignty by reasserting that water is a human right
        to be preserved by the community. Claiming water as a human right
        challenges the notion that any entity, state or individual can claim
        ownership of water resources. Moreover, it is through the most simple of
        cultural exchanges – communication and sharing – that we can
        collectively re-imagine water as a shared resource.
      </p>
      <h3 id="sanctuary">Sanctuary:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “…seek to embody a dynamic understanding of sanctuary that expresses
          various models of self-care, asylum, and refuge. In order to realize
          this site of embodied sanctuary, the Sanctuary collaborators have
          brainstormed what their notions of an ideal safe-space could look
          like, even if such a space only exists outside the bounds of reality.”
          (Philadelphia Assembled)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The PHLASK Project was first welcomed to the Philadelphia Assembled
        Initiative through, of all places, the sanctuary atmosphere manifested
        at the Sanctuary Dome. What can be distilled from the myriad of
        conversations had with curators and visitors at the Sanctuary Dome is
        that Sanctuary is a haven for peace and respite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although sanctuaries come in many different forms, and provide refuge
        against many of life’s harsh realities, PHLASK understands that water is
        equivalent to sanctuary for all carbon-based life. Water, the universal
        solvent, is the origin of life; life gestates in water. Our humanity is
        contingent upon our access to water.
      </p>
      <p>
        To expand access to water and redefine it as a public resources is to
        reimagine that all life deserves sanctuary. Water, and the physical
        systems that contain it can – and should – be treated as our shared
        sanctuary.
      </p>
      <h3 id="movement">Movement:</h3>
      <p>
        “The Movement atmosphere is looking at the intersections of the
        project’s eight public sites and proposing ways in which these sites can
        influence one another across the city and at the Museum.” (Philadelphia
        Assembled)
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the Movement atmosphere, the PHLASK Project aims to transcend the
        built and spatial boundaries of Philadelphia to build a network of water
        sharing. Much of the water infrastructure already zig-zags underground,
        past tunnels and sewers, into the homes, businesses, parks, industries
        and skyscrapers that make up our city. Reconnecting the disparate public
        and private taps into one, accessible PHLASK network is critical to
        re-imagining how people can obtain water as it flows throughout the
        city.
